PokerHandEval
=============

Poker 7 card hand evaluator for Haskell

This is based on the Two Plus Two hand evaluator from twoplustwo.com, and uses it's lookup table HandRanks.dat. You will need to get HandRanks.dat from somewhere and place it in the same directory as the haskell file. [Here](http://www.codingthewheel.com/archives/poker-hand-evaluator-roundup/#2p2) is an article that describes how to generate HandRanks.dat yourself, or you can just google for it and download it.
